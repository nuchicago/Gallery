For this example we will create a simple C-macro to iterate through the data products in an ArtRoot file. 

This is limited in that certain data-products cannot be accessed using these tools, specifically recob::Track and recob::Vertex will cause this to fail.

0) Source the setup script

1) You need is an artroot file. 

   Looking at the latest SBND MCC files from this talk:

   I selected this file...

1*) If you are unsure about what is inside that artroot file (i.e. data-products and producers) you can setupthe version of sbndcode used to create the artroot file and do:
    lar -c eventdump.fcl -s <YOUR_ARTROOT_FILE> -n 1

2) Next you can use the provided Test.C file. This reads in the above artroot file and looks a certain data product and then plots it as a histogram via: 

   root Test.C
